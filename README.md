## What is this?
This is my Manager README, a document that helps introduce you to my management style, philosophy, and expectations. The target audience is anyone who reports to me, but there are no secrets here, anyone is free to read it. Please treat this as a reference and promise on my conduct as a manager and my expectations of my teams.

I should be held accountable to these promises and would like to be informed of any omissions. Without feedback, improvement is difficult.

## My Job
As a manager, it is my job to:
* Attract, develop and retain world-class engineering talent 
* Manage and build well-functioning engineering teams
* Communicate my strategic and tactical intent
* Remove roadblocks from your path

While I've listed a some bulletpoints which I believe to define my job, I don't believe I'm above any job. When help is needed, let me know. If I fail to live up to my or your expectations, please feel free to tell me. If something can be done differently to make your or the team's life easier, I appreciate the chance to make that change.

## How I approach my job
--DRAFT--
I am responsible for everything.
My teams come first. I am here to make you successful.

I Listen, Learn, and then Lead. I need to maintain an objective point of view

My schedule may look full as I am typically in a number of meetings, I am not too busy. If you need to talk and are unable to find time on my calendar, DM or email me. I make time for what matters.

I believe in enabling my team with a high degree of trust and in decentralized command. I do not want to manage anyone, it is not a good use of either your or my time. I will go out of my way to ensure that you understand why goals are important or decisions have been made. This is not a one-way street, I believe in command and feedback.

I am data-driven.

I run by the following tenets:

* Mobilis in mobili - Changing in the changes. OODA loop
* Aut inveniam viam aut faciam - I shall either find a way or make one
